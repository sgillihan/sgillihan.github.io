    "### The Great Scrape: The Clash Between Sraping and Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping is defined as the automated extraction of large amounts of data from the internet, often using bots or web crawlers. It is widely used for AI training, web searching, archiving, and research but raises significant privacy concerns. Core privacy principles are defined as fairness, individual rights, transparency, consent, purpose specification, data minimization, onward transfer, and data security. The article purports that scraping and privacy principles are fundamentally at odds in the current landscape. A complete ban on scraping is impractical, but unregulated scraping poses significant privacy risks. A regulatory framework based on public interest and privacy principles is essential to balance the benefits of scraping with the protection of individual privacy. The article discusses the legalities of scraping in depth, including current European and USA legal case studies and existing laws. The article also touches on the possibility of discrimination that arises from data scraping. Ultimately, four principles are suggested to guide the future of data scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Reasonable Risk of Harm Principle: The collection, use, or transfer of scraped personal data should not cause unreasonable risk of harm to individuals, disadvantaged groups, or society.\n",
    "2) Proportional Benefits Principle: The collection, use, or transfer of scraped personal data should provide meaningful benefits to individuals, disadvantaged groups, and society sufficient to outweigh any risks and proportional to or in excess of the benefits to the scraper.\n",
    "3) Process Principle: The process for deciding the legitimate uses of scraped personal data should be fair, open, accountable, representative, equitable, and deliberative.\n",
    "4) Protections Principle: Scraped data should be afforded all the same protections as other personal data under privacy laws\n",
    "unless particular protections impose an unreasonable conflict with other public interest goals."
