## Featured Projects

### [Proxy Data Research: Socioeconomic Impacts](/projects/proxy-data-research/)
Exploring the technical and societal impacts of proxy data use in algorithms and AI/ML systems. This project investigates how personal data is collected, what parameters are used as proxies in decision-making algorithms, and the possibility of discrimination throughout the process.

### [Fenwick Tree Sports Tracker](/projects/fenwick-tree-sports-tracker/)
An early school project for my data structures class. Written in C++. This project demonstrates the strengths of the Fenwick Tree data structure.

### [One Handy Katie](/projects/one-handy-katie/)
A website for a local businesswoman. Built with Astro with Sanity CSM, and deployed on Netlify. This was my first project building a product for a "client". I had to keep in mind easy long term maintainence for a non-technical person.
