title: "Week 6 Update"
---

## Progress Since Last Post
- Summarized 2 more articles and added summaries to background research.

## Plan for Upcoming Week
- Re-evaluate what I want to use this time on. I am considering switching focus completely. I have an unfinished pressure calculation checker that I started when things were slow at work. Workload has increased, so I haven't finished the pressure checker. That would give me another finished project, rather than just a bunch of research. I also might continue work on my dissolved project for 3308. I forked the repo so I have the option. I was really interested in the tools I had started to work with.

## Impediments
- My team project in Software Development Methods and Tools derailed my week.
- Low motivation in general

## Ideas for Process Improvement
- Take Thursday and Friday evening off of school in order to clear my head and try to reset.
