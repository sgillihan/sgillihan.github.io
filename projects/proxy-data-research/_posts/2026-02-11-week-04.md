title: "Week 4 Update"
---

## Progress Since Last Post
- Reviewed Prof. Guinn feedback and available peer feedback on proposal
- Finished reading a 65 page paper and added a summary to background research
- requested personal google data for exploratory purposes
- downloaded COMPAS (criminal justice) and HMDA (mortgage applicatio) datasets for future exploration
- Cloned GitHub Page repo to local IDE for easier editing and better organization
- Processed and cleaned browser history data from personal google data download. Started some exploratory analysis. 

## Plan for Upcoming Week
- Continue exploration of Google Data and document processes and code in appropriate locations
- Begin processing/setup for HMDA data- I think this is what I will focus on later.
- Read another article and summarize
- GitHub page improvements- navigation is not great, need to fix

## Impediments
- Time management- I overspent time on this class this week
- Everything that is related to set up / processing / working with new file formats is still painfully slow and error-prone for me, even when using AI tools. 

## Ideas for Process Improvement
- I believe I will be able to re-use some of the processing code for each data type as I get it set up. Need to examine and fix my code for processing JSON so that it is definitely reusable, as this will save a lot of time.
