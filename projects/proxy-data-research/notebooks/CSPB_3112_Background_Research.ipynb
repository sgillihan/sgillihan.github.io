    "### Constructing Applicants from Loan-Level Data: A Case Study of Mortgage Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This study develops a clustering-based algorithm to identify \"cross-applicants\", defined as individuals submitting multiple mortgage applications, in anonymized loan-level datasets such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data. ​The algorithm uses hierarchical agglomerative clustering with a nearest neighbor chaining method and optimizes tuning parameters without labeled training data. Applied to HMDA data (2018–2023), the method achieved 92.3% precision, identifying over 314,000 cross-applicant clusters.​ \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Applications:\n",
    "1. Measuring Fairness: Cross-applicants can help assess fairness in mortgage lending decisions across demographic groups. \n",
    "2. Monitoring Credit Conditions: Identifying marginal borrowers can provide insights into lenders' strictness and credit conditions over time and across regions. \n",
    "3. Studying Mortgage Shopping Behavior: The dataset can be used to analyze how borrowers compare lenders and how shopping behavior varies across demographics. "

    "### The Great Scrape: The Clash Between Sraping and Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping is defined as the automated extraction of large amounts of data from the internet, often using bots or web crawlers. It is widely used for AI training, web searching, archiving, and research but raises significant privacy concerns. Core privacy principles are defined as fairness, individual rights, transparency, consent, purpose specification, data minimization, onward transfer, and data security. The article purports that scraping and privacy principles are fundamentally at odds in the current landscape. A complete ban on scraping is impractical, but unregulated scraping poses significant privacy risks. A regulatory framework based on public interest and privacy principles is essential to balance the benefits of scraping with the protection of individual privacy. The article discusses the legalities of scraping in depth, including current European and USA legal case studies and existing laws. The article also touches on the possibility of discrimination that arises from data scraping. Ultimately, four principles are suggested to guide the future of data scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Reasonable Risk of Harm Principle: The collection, use, or transfer of scraped personal data should not cause unreasonable risk of harm to individuals, disadvantaged groups, or society.\n",
    "2) Proportional Benefits Principle: The collection, use, or transfer of scraped personal data should provide meaningful benefits to individuals, disadvantaged groups, and society sufficient to outweigh any risks and proportional to or in excess of the benefits to the scraper.\n",
    "3) Process Principle: The process for deciding the legitimate uses of scraped personal data should be fair, open, accountable, representative, equitable, and deliberative.\n",
    "4) Protections Principle: Scraped data should be afforded all the same protections as other personal data under privacy laws\n",
    "unless particular protections impose an unreasonable conflict with other public interest goals."

    "### A Common Pool of Privacy Problems: Legal and Technical Lessons from a Large-Scale Web-Scraped Machine Learning Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper audits a massive web-scraped AI training dataset (DataComp CommonPool, 12.8B samples) and finds substantial amounts of personal and sensitive information despite automated cleaning efforts. The authors show that large-scale internet scraping inevitably captures personally identifiable information (PII), including identity documents, resumes, faces, and sensitive demographic data. They argue that current privacy laws—especially exemptions for “publicly available” data—are poorly equipped to address the risks posed by AI systems trained on indiscriminately scraped web data. The paper concludes that policymakers should regulate dataset creation (“the root”) rather than focusing only on downstream AI models (“the leaves”)."
