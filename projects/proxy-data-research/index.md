# Researching Socioeconomic Impacts and Technical Aspects of Proxy Data Use

## About This Project
The motivation for this project began with the book Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil. We are living in a world where an individual's data is used for everything from advertising to loan decisions, but the individual rarely has access to their own data and even more rarely understands all of the assumptions that are made based on the data. 

The primary goal of this project is to lay the groundwork for future development of an application which would make an individual's data and the ways in which it is used more transparent to the individual. Topics of exploration include algorithmic bias, proxy discrimination, data scraping, data processing, and data analysis.
